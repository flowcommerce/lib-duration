Scala library to make working with Flow's Common Duration object easier.

# Installation

```
   "io.flow" %% "lib-duration" % "0.0.1"
```

# Usage

```
  import io.flow.common.v0.models.Duration
  import io.flow.duration.InternalDuration
```

# Key Features

  - Sorting: `InternalDuration` extends `Ordered` making durations shortable
  - `UnitOfTimeLabel` provides for a pretty label
